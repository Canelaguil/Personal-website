        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
            I’m finishing up my bachelor degree Computer Science, but I also once presided a tech 
            organisation, did a (granted, short) journalism internship at a major Dutch newspaper 
            and have organized conferences and other events. I also dabble in writing and have a 
            lot of Opinions on video games and video game narratives.
